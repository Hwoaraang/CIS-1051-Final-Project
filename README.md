I wanted to do a project where I made a webpage because I already have some experience working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript when I took a computer science class during high school. However, it's
been a couple years since I took that class so I forgot mostly everything about those languages but I remember a website I used to help me learn when I was back in high school called freecodecamp.org
so before starting my project, I spent a few days to study and practice using the languages with the free courses they offer. When I felt like I learned enough to build a basic webpage, I started my
project but making a webpage was more difficult than I thought. My main problem was coming up with the design of the webpages and how to lay everything out. I also found CSS a pain to work with because
a lot of the times, it did not make some of the elements of my webpage look how I wanted it to but when I finally finished up everything, it was a really nice feeling and I enjoyed how some of the 
webpages looked.
