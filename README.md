I wanted to do a project where I made a webpage because I already have some experience working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript when I took a computer science class during high school. However, it's
been a couple years since I took that class so I forgot mostly everything about those languages but I remember a website I used to help me learn when I was back in high school called freecodecamp.org
so before starting my project, I spent a few days to study and practice using the languages with the free courses they offer. When I felt like I learned enough to build a basic webpage, I started my
project but making a webpage was more difficult than I thought. My main problem was coming up with the design of the webpages and how to lay everything out. I also found CSS a pain to work with because
a lot of the times, it did not make some of the elements of my webpage look how I wanted it to but when I finally finished up everything, it was a really nice feeling and I enjoyed how some of the 
webpages looked. Orginally, I wanted to do some more advanced things with CSS but I alraedy found the CSS that I did for the webpage a little difficult and it was frustrating so I didn't think I was
ready for that. I also wanted to add more buttons using JavaScript to make the webpage more interactive but it was really hard to come up with ideas on how to use the buttons and what actions to make
it perform.
