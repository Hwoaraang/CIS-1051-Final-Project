# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

"Yibin's Homepage"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website tells the user about myself.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My homepage will be made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It will tell you information about me like fun facts etc. It will also contain interactive buttons made with Javascript so the user can click on and interact with the page to go to different sections. I plan on using VSCode and it's live server extension to execute the project.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A well designed and good looking homepage with at least a few interactive buttons that will lead to to more pages about me.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Using CSS, I could maybe make the webpages look more aesthetically pleasing.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Using CSS, I could maybe add plenty of nice effects like hover effects or maybe animations when you scroll through the page.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to research how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. First of all, I need to make sure everything I want to put on the webpage is on the HTML code. Then I need to make the interactive buttons work using JavaScript. Lastly, I will use CSS to work on the webpage's design and looks.
